# Candide Thovex Tribute Page

I chose this subject as Candide is my favourite skier and he has been pushing the boundaries of what is possible for almost 20 years. His return from a devastating injury is also really inspiring. His videos are some of the most entertaining ski films available and they are always guaranteed to make me feel excited about getting back to the mountains. 

I learned a lot during this process though I definitely need a _lot_ more practice! The myriad of different elemts, styles and variables all still feel like a maze and I was definitely googling a lot to help me out. I'm very much a 'learn by doing' person though and I'm sure this will become second nature in no time :) I didn't use any JS for my tribute page but having watched the video and played with some of the initial activities I'm picking it up quickly. While the syntax is slightly different the concepts of OOP, variables, functions etc is the same as the Python I was learning for the past few months.
