        <h2 id="headline"> Candide's timeline</h2>
              <ul id="list">
          <li> Born 22 May 1982 in Annecy and spent his childhood skiing in the La Clusaz area</li>
          <li> Won the French National Junior Championship at age 14 in the 'moguls' division</li>
          <li> Signed his first professional contract in 1997 and caught the attention of the world by being the first person to clear Chad's Gap (Utah, USA) in 1999. The following year he successfully landed a 720 rotation over it, which was the first ever successful rotation over a large natural gap. He was 17 years old</li>
   <li>He spent the next several years competing in freestyle skiing, including several medals in the prestigious X-Games </li>
   <li>He came to the attention of the skiing community again in 2001 at Superpark 3 by landing by far the largest jump ever seen on a halfpipe and clearing some of the largest Big Air jumps ever seen</li>
    <li>in 2007 he built the largest kicker (freestyle ski jump) ever attempted which he named 'Big Bertha'. Unfortunately, during his attempt to clear this he crashed and fractured his verterbrae. He was told he might never ski again </li>   
      <li>Despite this enormous setback, the following year he was back on skis. No longer able to land the huge jumps of his youth, he turned his attention to Big Mountain skiing in the wild mountains of Europe and North America </li> 
       <li> In an incredible moment, he entered the Chamonix stage of the prestigious Freeride World Tour and won. He then went on to compete in the 3 remaining stages and was able to clinch the overall title, just over 1 year after being told he might never ski again </li> 
         <li> In more recent years, he has turned his attention to filmmaking including the award winning documentary 'Few Words' and a series of highly acclaimed shorts title "One of Those Days"  - the first of which you can see below</li></ul>
